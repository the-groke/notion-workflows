# Notion Workflows

A collection of automated workflows that manage and enrich Notion databases — from meal planning and shopping lists to travel guides and pub crawl routes. Runs nightly via GitHub Actions using TypeScript, the Notion API, and Google Gemini AI.

## Workflows

### Cleanup Shopping

Deletes checked-off to-do items from Notion shopping list pages and ensures every heading retains at least one empty to-do beneath it. Reused across multiple lists (grocery, Turkish supermarket, Asian supermarket, and general to-do).

```sh
npx tsx workflows/cleanup-shopping/index.ts
```

### Events Calendar

Generates recurring calendar events in a Notion "Events" database from templates defined in a "Repeat Events" database. Reads weekday, week ordinal, and excluded months from each template, then creates events for the next 12 months — skipping any that already exist.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/events-calendar/index.ts
```

### Manage Meal Planner

Maintains a rolling 28-day meal planner. Archives past days, creates missing future day pages, and corrects any incorrectly formatted day names.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/manage-meal-planner/index.ts
```

### Manage Shopping

End-to-end shopping list manager. Queries the meal planner for the next 7 days' meals, extracts their ingredients into a "Shopping Helper" database, then uses **Gemini AI** to categorize checked items under the correct heading on each shopping list page. Processed items are archived automatically.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/manage-shopping/index.ts
```

### Populate Films & TV

Enriches a films/TV database with metadata from **TMDB** and **OMDb** APIs — poster images, overview, runtime, genres, directors, writers, countries, year, IMDB score, Tomatometer, and Metascore.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/populate-films-and-tv/index.ts
```

### Populate Meals

Uses **Gemini AI** to auto-complete meal recipes with ingredients and cooking instructions. Follows British English naming conventions and specific formatting rules defined in a prompt template.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/populate-meals/index.ts
```

### Populate Pubs

Calculates an optimal pub crawl route for a given location. Extracts geolocation from Notion's Place property, computes distances using the Haversine formula, optimizes visit order via a nearest-neighbour algorithm, and appends a Google Maps walking route link.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/populate-pubs/index.ts
```

### Populate Travel Database

Uses **Gemini AI** to annotate travel destinations with typical stay length, best season, highlights, activities, flight options (from Leeds/Manchester/London), and transport information.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/populate-travel-database/index.ts
```

### Populate Walks Database

Uses **Gemini AI** to annotate walking locations with distance from home, transport options, walk type, parking, routes, terrain, and nearby pubs.

```sh
npx tsx workflows/populate-walks-database/index.ts
```

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 22, TypeScript via [tsx](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx)
- **Notion:** [`@notionhq/client`](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js)
- **AI:** [`@google/genai`](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai) (Gemini 2.5 Flash, JSON response mode)
- **Film APIs:** [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions on nightly cron schedules (all workflows also support `workflow_dispatch`)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   All secrets are managed via GitHub Actions. For local development, create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   # Notion
   NOTION_TOKEN=secret_...
   PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=secret_...    # For private databases

   # Database / Page IDs
   MEAL_PLANNER_DATABASE_ID=...
   MEALS_DATABASE_ID=...
   SHOPPING_HELPER_DATABASE_ID=...
   GROCERY_SHOPPING_LIST_PAGE_ID=...
   TURKISH_SUPERMARKET_LIST_PAGE_ID=...
   ASIAN_SUPERMARKET_LIST_PAGE_ID=...
   EVENTS_DATABASE_ID=...
   REPEAT_EVENTS_DATABASE_ID=...
   FILMS_DATABASE_ID=...
   TRAVEL_DATABASE_ID=...
   WALKS_DATABASE_ID=...
   PUBS_DATABASE_ID=...
   PUBS_PAGE_ID=...

   # APIs
   GEMINI_API_KEY=...
   TMDB_API_KEY=...
   OMDB_API_KEY=...

   # Location
   HOME_LOCATION=...
   STATION_WAYPOINT=...
   LOCATION=...
   ```

3. **Run a workflow locally:**

   ```sh
   npx tsx workflows/<workflow-name>/index.ts
   ```
